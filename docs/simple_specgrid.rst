Simple Specgrid Operations
**************************

The first step is too obtain an appropriate specgrid from the author. We will be dealing with the munari specgrid here.
Opening the specgrid can work in that way::

    >>> from specgrid import specgrid
    >>> munari_grid = specgrid.SpecGrid('munari.h5')
